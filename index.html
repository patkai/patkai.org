<h1>Quotes</h1>
<p> 
	I've been collecting these quotes since the end of the previous century. Some of them are funny, some others thought provoking or at least original, but I don't necessarily find all of them true. <!-- Whenever I did the translation from Hungarian I make a note, but I admit I haven't checked all of them yet for authenticity. In the future I plan to add references, but don't hold your breath, I have my priorities sorted :)-->

	<li><strong>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</strong> <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt" target="_blank">Teddy Roosevelt</a></em></li>

	<!--<li>The Mythical Man-Month:
Assigning more programmers to a project running behind schedule, may make it even more late.

The Second-System Effect:
The second system an engineer designs is the most bloated system she will EVER design.

Conceptual Integrity:
To retain conceptual integrity and thereby user-friendliness, a system must have a single architect (or a small system architecture team), completely separate from the implementation team.

The Manual:
The chief architect should produce detailed written specifications for the system in the form of the manual, which leaves no ambiguities about any part of the system and completely specifies the external spcifications of the system i.e. what the user sees.

Pilot Plant:
When designing a new kind of system, a team should factor in the fact that they will have to throw away the first system that is built since this first system will teach them how to build the system. The system will then be completely redesigned using the newly acquired insights during building of the first system. This second system will be smarter and should be the one delivered to the customer.

Formal Documents:
Every project manager must create a roadmap in the form of formal documents which specifies milestones precisely and things like who is going to do what and when and at what cost.

Communication:
In order to avoid disaster, all the teams working on a project, such as the architecture and implementation teams, should stay in contact with each other in as many ways as possible and not guess or assume anything about the other. Ask whenever there's a doubt. NEVER assume anything.

Code Freeze and System Versioning:
No customer ever fully knows what she wants from the system she wants you to build. As the system begins to come to life, and the customer interacts with it, he understands more and more what he really wants from the system and consequently asks for changes. These changes should of course be accomodated but only upto a certain date, after which the code is frozen. All requests for more changes will have to wait until the NEXT version of the system. If you keep making changes to the system endlessly, it may NEVER get finished.

Specialized Tools:
Every team should have a designated tool maker who makes tools for the entire team, instead of all individuals developing and using their private tools that no one else understands.

No silver bullet:
There is no single strategy, technique or trick that will exponentially raise the productivity of programmers.

	Minden jóindulat˙ gesztusod az átlagember szemében szükségképpen a gyengeség jelének tünik. Soha nem hiszi el neked, hogy nem a helyzet kényszerének engedtél, hanem a negylelküség vezetett - neki a saját életében nincsenek ilyen tapasztalatai.</li> 

	<li>Óvakodj azoktól a barátaidtól, akik azonnal tőrleszteni akarják nekik tett szolgálataidat! 
	Igyekvésük mőgőtt általában nem a hálaérzés rejlik, hanem bizalmatlanság és az elzárkózó szándék. Nem akarnak adósaid lenni, hogy ne legyenek viszontszolgálatra kőtelezve. (Ennek azert mas oka is lehet...)

Ne ismerd el a vereségedet, és akkor nem vesztettél 
Hidd el, hogy mind a győztes, mind a küzdelemre figyelő kőzőnség gyenge eresztésnek számít. Csak akkor biztos egy küzdelem eldőltében, ha maga a vesztes nyíltan kijelenti, hogy valóban legyőzték - ellenkező esetben még mindig él benne némi bizonytalanság. Te ne siess ezt eloszlatni. 
Kis ügyességgel és a kőrülmények szerencsés alakulásával később azt is el tudod hitetni, hogy valójában a győztes vesztett. Vedd példának a parlamenti választásokat vagy a hábor˙kat. 

Az ellenfeled stílusa téged is meghatároz 
Ritkán választhatod meg, hogy hol, mikor, kivel és milyen fegyverekkel óhajtanál csatázni. Ha éjszaka egy mocsár szélén sártól csőpőgő bikacsőkőt vagy baseballütőt emelnek rád, csak az esztelen vagy az őngyilkosjelőlt póbál meg egy filozófiai idézettel védekezni, neked legalább egy botot kell ragadnod. 
Persze az ilyen harcok rád is visszahatnak. "Aki szőrnyetegekkel viaskodik, az előbb-utóbb szőrnyeteggé válik maga is, és aki sokáig néz az őrvénybe, arra az őrvény visszanéz" - mondta erről Nietzsche. 

Ha a lehetőségeinkből már kifogytunk, akkor legalább a lehetetlenben meg kell őrizni a hitünket 
A reménytelenségnek is van egy előnyős oldala: felszabadít minket minden merev felelősségtudat alól, képessé válhatunk a csodák felismerésére és megvalósítására. 

Minden harcnak vannak győztesei és nyertesei 
A külőnbség abban áll, hogy a győztes a győzelemért küzdőtt, a nyertes a nyereményért. A két réteg a küzdelem hevében ősszekeveredhet, de csak a legritkább esetben válik azonossá. 

Aki elmegy, az veszített 
Amíg ott maradsz a konfliktusaid színhelyén, mindig marad valami halovány esélyed a sikerre. Ha elmégy, átengedted a terepet az ellenségednek, az ő akarata és szándéka érvényesül majd minden korlát nélkül. A távollevőknek soha nem lehet igazuk.

JUST A QUESTION OF STANDARDS

Does the statement, "We've always done it that way" ring any bells...? The
US standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5
inches.
That's an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? Because that's
the
way they built them in England, and English expatriates built the US
Railroads.

Why did the English build them like that? Because the first rail lines were
built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's
the
gauge they used. Why did "they" use that gauge then? Because the people who
built the tramways used the same jigs and spacing. Okay! Why did the wagons
have that particular odd wheel spacing? Well, if they tried to use any
other
spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, long distance
roads
in England, because that's the spacing of the wheel ruts.

So who built those old rutted roads?

Imperial Rome built the first long distance roads in Europe (and England)
for
their legions. The roads have been used ever since. And the ruts in the
roads?
Roman war chariots formed the initial ruts, which everyone else had to
match
for fear of destroying their wagon wheels. Since the chariots were made for
Imperial Rome, they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing.

The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches is derived
from the original specifications for an Imperial Roman war chariot. And
bureaucracies live forever.

So the next time you are handed a spec and told we have always done it that
way and wonder what horse's ass came up with that, you may be exactly
right,
because the Imperial Roman war chariots were made wide enough to
accommodate
the rear ends of two war horses. Now the twist to the story...

When you see a Space Shuttle sitting on its launch pad, there are two big
booster rockets attached to the sides of the main fuel tank. These are
solid
rocket boosters, or SRBs. The SRBs are made by Thiokol at their factory in
Utah. The engineers who designed the SRBs would have preferred to make them
a
bit fatter, but the SRBs had to be shipped by train from the factory to the
launch site.

The railroad line from the factory happens to run through a tunnel in the
mountains. The SRBs had to fit through that tunnel. The tunnel is slightly
wider than the railroad track, and the railroad track, as you now know, is
about as wide as two horses' behinds.

So, a major Space Shuttle design feature of what is arguably the world's
most
advanced transportation system was determined over two thousand years ago
by
the width of a Horse's arse.

And you thought being a horse's arse wasn't important??

'érvényes' maradt, '˙j', meghőkkentő, kívánatos, általánosan elfogadott 
parancs."

"Nagy kiváltság megőrizni az ép eszünket: bármikor megvonhatják tőlünk."

"Tudni, hogy mi a fontos -- az a legritkább dolog a világon. Mindazok kőzül 
akiket ismertem, oly kevesen tűntek ki ebben a tekintetben, hogy akár meg is 
nevezhetném őket. Négyen vagy őten voltak ősszesen."

"Abban a reményben olvasok ilyen sokat, hogy egy szép napon olyan magányra 
bukkanok, ami nagyobb, mint az enyém."

"Bármilyen érdemes ember is, aki becsvágyó, csak a felszínen lehet

Tudományos pályafutásra is vonatkoztatható dolgok(Tar Jozsef szerint):

"Annak alapján fognak megítélni, amit írtam, nem pedig annak alapján, amit 
olvastam. Ezt a nevetségesen nyilvánvaló tényt gyakran tévesztem szem elől. 
Minden kőnyv után, amit felfaltam, némi érdemet tulajdonítok magamnak."

"Abbahagyta az írást: már nem volt mit rejtegetnie."

"Száz levélből, amit egy író kap, egyetlen egy érdemel figyelmet. Csaknem 
valamennyit aszerint írják, hogy az ˙jságok, folyóiratok mennyit 
foglalkoznak Veled. Nem az inspirálja őket, amit írtál, hanem az, amit Rólad 
írtak. Minden területen minden "second hand". Legyünk szerények! Én 
megpróbáltam a szerénységet, váltakozó sikerrel. De azért remélem, hogy egy 
szép napon elsajátítom. Erre való a halál."

"A virtuozitás minden téren a semmi jele, a civilizációk hajnalán nem is 
találkozunk vele. Ezért van oly sok igazság a kezdetkor, és olyan kevés a 
siker beteljesedése idején. Csak a vágy pillanata számít, mindenben. Ami 
utána kővetkezik finomkodás, csak rutin."

"Egyetlen aranyszabály van az irodalomban és a művészetekben: nem hagyni 
hátra magunkról teljes képet."

One of the most challenging goals in chemistry is to synthesize a complex
natural compound from simple substances commonly available. Sometimes
up to a hundred reactions, one after the other, are needed. They are called
together a synthon. Every synthon is a remarkable example of thinking
holistically. Wholeness ("identity-context") is another of the 7Es.

	<li>The Top 10 most well known or significant Complexity Sciences principles

(1)Hierarchical structure as
(a) extensional complexity (hierarchies of scale)
(b) intensional complexity (specification hierarchies, as in, e.g.,
{physical world {material world {biological world }}}, wherein a system
could be analyzed from several different viewpoints.
(2) Multiple contextuality.  Each context requires a different take on a
system
(3) Nonequilibrium.  A material complex system could only approach, never
reach equilibrium before it gets recycled
(4) Change -- that is, unpredictable change (as individuation or evolution)
(5) Vagueness (because systems are neither this nor that, but in transit)
(6) Development.  That is, the homeostasis concept needs to be supplemented
with homeorhesis
(7) Growth.  Growth in any sense in the material world is always held in a
diminishing returns pattern, such that senescence will ultimately overtake
a system. It will be mature for a relatively short time
(8) Increase in order is always accompanied by increase in disorder, as the
number of ways a system needs to recover from perturbations increases with
its embodied information, as well as the fact that as a system gets
morecomplex, its behavior tends to get more unpedictable as well
(9) Generativity.  Complex systems do not always do the same things, nor do
they only suffer markings from outside.  They change voluntarily and
unexpectedly from within
(10)  Reflexivity.  A complex system's actions change it, and, as well,
tend to feed back upon it

I believe that these pinciples apply, in principle, to abiotic
dissipative structures as well as to living and social ones.

and perceive all other things, takes no notice of itself;
and it requires art and pains to set it at a distance and
make it its own object."

PHYSICS - ECOLOGY 
The more you look, the simpler it gets - The more you look, the more complex it gets 

Primacy of initial conditions - Primacy of contingency and complex historical factors 

Universal patterns; search for laws - Weak trends; reluctance to seek laws 

Predictive (chaos and quantum mechanics notwithstanding) - Mostly descriptive, explanatory

The sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to interpret, they mainly make models. By a model is meant a mathematical construct which, with the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes observed phenomena.

Occam's (or Ockham's) razor is a principle attributed to the 14th century logician and Franciscan friar; William of Occam.  Ockham was the village in the English county of Surrey where he was born.

The principle states that "Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily." Sometimes it is quoted in one of its original Latin forms to give it an air of authenticity.

"Pluralitas non est ponenda sine neccesitate"
"Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora"
"Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem"

Many scientists have adopted or reinvented Occam's Razor as in Leibniz' "identity of observables" and Isaac Newton stated the rule: "We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances."

The most useful statement of the principle for scientists is,

"when you have two competing theories which make exactly the same predictions, the one that is simpler is the better."

Ernst Mach advocated a version of Occam's razor which he called the Principle of Economy, stating that "Scientists must use the simplest means of arriving at their results and exclude everything not perceived by the senses."

"Independence is for the very few; it is a privilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it even with the best right but without inner constraint proves that he is probably not only strong, but also daring to the point of recklessness. He enters into a labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life brings with it in any case, not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way, becomes lonely, and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience. Supposing one like that comes to grief, this happens so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it nor sympathize. And he cannot go back any longer. Nor can he go back to the pity of men."

Edward O. Wilson, Consilience (HE WAS RAISED AS SOUTHERN BAPTIST, BORN AGAIN AND BAPTIZED!)
"I had experienced the Ionian Enchantement. That recently coined expression I borrow from the physicist and historian Gerald Holton. It means a belief in the unity of the sciences - a conviction, far deeper than a mere working proposition, that the world is orderly and can be explained by a small number of natural laws. Its roots go back to Thales of Miletus, in Ionia, in the sixth century B.C. The legendary philosopher was considered by Aristotle two centruries later to be the founder of the physical sciences. He is of course remembered more concretely for his belief that all matter consists ultimately of water. Although the notion is often cited as an example of how far astray early Greek speculation could wander, its real significance is the metaphysics it expressed about the material basis of the world and the unity of nature. The Enchantment, growing steadily more sophisticated, has dominated scientific thought ever since." "The idea of the unity of science is not idle. It has been tested in acid baths of experiment and logic and enjoyed repeated vindication. It has suffered no decisive defeats. At least not yet, even though at its center, by the very nature of the scientific method, it must be thought always vulnerable."
Einsteind said to Marcel Grossmann in a letter "It is a wonderful feeling to recognize the unity of a complex of phenomena that to direct observation appear to be quite separate things."
"All scientists, Einstein not excepted, are children of Tantalus, frustrated by the failure to grasp that which seems within reach."
Shelley: "Better damned with Plato and Bacon, than go to heaven with Paley and Malthus."
"Such, I believe, is the source of the Ionian Enchantment: Preferring a search for objective reality over revelation is another way of satisfying religious hunger. It is an endeavor almost as old as civilization and intertwined with traditional religion, but it follows a very different course - a stoic's creed, an acquired taste, a guidebook to adventure plotted across rough terrain. It aims to save the spirit, not by surrender but by liveration of the human mind. Its central tenet, as Einstein knew, is the unification of knowledge. When we have unified enough certain knowledge, we will understand who we are and why we are here. If those committed to the quest fail, they will be forgiven. When lost, they will find anouther way. The moral imperative of humanism is the endeavor alone, whether successful or not, provided the effort is honorable and failure memorable".
astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar to his mentor, Sir Arthur Eddington: "Let us see how high we can fly before the sun melts the wax in our wings."

"The assumptions of the Enlightenment:
1. lawful material world
2. intrinsic unity of knowledge
3. potential of indefinit human progress"

"The ongoing fragmentation of knowledge and resulting chaos in philosophy are not reflections of the real world but artifacts of scholarship."

Francis Bacon "Confusion occures wherever argument or inference passes from one world of experience to another".

Because this perspective is rare among CEOs and the political elite, both groups exaggerate the impact of policies, Geyer believes, and tend to dismiss the often fatal, unintended consequences those policies engender.

Maximum Entropy Method in Soft Design 

Antonio Donnarumma 

Michele Pappalardo 

Abstract
In this paper is analysed the problem, using soft models, of soft dependence of parameters in design systems. A new form of computing, called Soft Computing, is recently used in many emerging disciplines because is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty and partial truth. The Soft Computing uses many disciplines as Bayesian inference and Maximum Entropy Method . The logic relationship that tie the different elements can be defined more easy using the axioms of soft design coming out from MinEnt principle . The fundamental axiom of design is: Valid design has minimum values of information and depends on a finite and limited number of independent, or soft dependent, parameters. 
Keywords: Soft Design, Soft Computing, Uncertainty, Entropy,MaxEnt, Axiomatic Design.

Ami itt feloldódik, az a tudományágaknak az az állapota, amely egy idejétm˙lt tudományosságnak felel meg. Minél általánosabbak és elvontabbak a tudás tárgyai (a psziché, az anyag, a szám, a naprendszer, a gazdagság, a társadalom stb.), annál tőbbféle, látszólag strukturált és autonóm tudományágnak kell együtt kőzelítenie hozzájuk: a pszichológiának, a fizikának, az aritmetikának, az égi mechanikának, a gazdaságnak, a szociológiának. A 19. század tudománya abból állt, hogy kidolgozta ezeknek a tárgyaknak az ismeretét. Ezért volt olyan diadalmas: a tudósok azt hitték, hogy véglegesen meghatározták saját tárgyukat, és hamarosan ki is merítik majd. A 20. században derült csak ki, hogy valamennyi tárgy sokkal ősszetettebb, mint hitték, és ha valóban le akarjuk írni oket, számtalan terület irányából kell kőzelítenünk hozzájuk.

A politikai kormányzat pénz hiányában és a hatalom hatékony megtartása érdekében elkezdte áttolni bizonyos feladatok megvalósítását a nagyvállalatokra, legjobb példa a kutatás, mert azon lehetett jól spórolni.

A Metaphor

Through SCI conferences, we are trying to relate the analytic thinking required in focused conference sessions, to the synthetic thinking, required for analogy generation, which call for multi-focus domain and divergent thinking. We are trying to promote a synergic relation between analytically and synthetically oriented minds, as it is found between left and right brain hemispheres, by means of the corpus callosum. Then, SCI 2001 might be perceived as a research corpus callosum, trying to bridge analytically with synthetically oriented efforts, convergent with divergent thinkers and focused specialists with non-focused or multi-focused generalists.

I do not accept any absolute formulas for living. No preconceived code can see ahead to everything that can happen in a man's life. As we live, we grow and our beliefs change. They must change.

Berkeley Initiative in Soft Computing (BISC)
To: BISC GroupFrom: L. A. Zadeh <zadeh@cs.berkeley.edu>-------Toward the Concept of Generalized Definability Lotfi A. Zadeh*(Abstract of a lecture presented at the Rolf Nevanlinna Colloquium, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland, August 8, 2000)Attempts to formulate mathematically precise definitions of basic concepts such as causality, randomness, probability and intelligence have a long history. The concept of generalized definability which is outlined in this lecture suggests that such definitions exist. Furthermore, it suggests that existing definitions of many basic concepts, among them those of stability, statistical independence and Pareto-optimality, may be in need of redefinition.In essence, definability is concerned with whether and how a concept, X, can be defined in a way that lends itself to mathematical analysis and computation. In mathematics, definability of mathematical concepts is taken for granted. But as we move farther into the age of machine intelligence and automated reasoning, the issue of definability is certain to grow in importance and visibility, raising basic questions which are not easy to resolve.To be more specific, let X be the concept of, say, a summary, and assume that I am instructing a machine to generate a summary of a given article or a book. To execute my instruction, the machine must be provided with a definition of what is meant by a summary. It is somewhat paradoxical that we have summarization programs which can summarize, albeit in a narrowly prescribed sense, without being able to formulate a general definition of summarization. The same applies to the concepts of causality, randomness and probability. Indeed, it may be argued that these and many other basic concepts cannot be defined within the conceptual framework of classical logic and set theory.The point of departure in our approach to definability is the assumption that definability has a hierarchical structure. Furthermore, it is understood that a definition must be unambiguous, precise, operational, general and co-extensive with the concept which it defines.The hierarchy involves five different types of definability. The lowest level is that of c-definability, with c standing for crisp. Thus, informally, a concept, X, is c-definable if it is a crisp concept, e.g., a prime number, a linear system or a Gaussian distribution. The domain of X is the space of instances to which X applies.The next level is that of f-definability, with f standing for fuzzy. Thus, X is a fuzzy concept if its denotation, F, is a fuzzy set in its universe of discourse. A fuzzy concepts is associated with a membership function which assigns to each point, u, in the universe of discourse of X, the degree to which u is a member of F. A fuzzy concept is defined by its membership function or in terms of other fuzzy concepts. Examples of fuzzy concepts are small number, strong evidence and similarity. It should be noted that many concepts associated with fuzzy sets are crisp concepts. An example is the concept of a convex fuzzy set. Most fuzzy concepts are context-dependent.The next level is that of f.g-definability, with g standing for granular, and f.g denoting the conjunction of fuzzy and granular. Informally, in the case of a concept which is f.g-granular, the values of attributes are granulated, with a granule being a clump of values which are drawn together by indistinguishability, similarity, proximity or functionality. f.g-granularity reflects the bounded ability of the human mind to resolve detail and store information. An example of an f.g-granular concept which is traditionally defined as a crisp concept, is that of statistical independence. This is a case of misdefinition -- a definition which is applied to instances for which the concept is not defined, e.g., fuzzy events. In particular, a common misdefinition is to treat a concept as if it were c-definable whereas in fact it is not.The next level is that of PNL-definability, where PNL stands for Precisiated Natural Language. Basically, PNL consists of propositions drawn from a natural language which can be precisiated through translation into what is called precisiation language. An example of a proposition in PNL is: It is very unlikely that there will be a significant increase in the price of oil in the near future.In the case of PNL, the precisiation language is the Generalized Constraint Language (GCL). A generic generalized constraint is represented by Z isr R, where Z is the constrained variable, R is the constraining relation and r is a discrete-valued indexing variable whose values define the ways in which R constrains Z. The principal types of constraints are: possibilistic (r=blank); veristic (r=v); probabilistic (r=p); random set (r=rs); usuality (r=u); fuzzy graph (r=fg); and Pawlak set (r=ps). The rationale for constructing a large variety of constraints is that of conventional crisp constraints are in capable of representing the meaning of propositions expressed in a natural language -- most of which are intrinsically imprecise -- in a form that lends itself to computation.The elements of GCL are composite generalized constraints which are formed from generic generalized constraints by combination, modification and qualification. An example of a generalized constraint in GCL is ((Z isp R) and ((Z,Y) is S) is unlikely.By construction, the Generalized Constraint Language is maximally expressive. What this implies is that PNL is the largest subset of a natural language which admits precisiation. Informally, this implication serves as a basis for the conclusion that if a concept, X, cannot be defined in terms of PNL, then, in effect, it is undefinable or, synonymously, amorphic.In this perspective, the highest level of definability hierarchy, which is the level above PNL-definability, is that of undefinability or amorphicity. A canonical example of an amorphic concept is that of causality. More specifically, is it not possible to construct a general definition of causality such that given any two events A and B and the question, "Did A cause B?" the question could be answered based on the definition. Equivalently, given any definition of causality, it will always be possible to construct examples to which the definition would not apply or yield counterintuitive results.In dealing with an amorphic concept, X, what is possible -- and what we generally do -- is to restrict the domain of applicability of X to instances for which X is definable. For example, in the case of the concept of a summary, which is an amorphic concept, we could restrict the length, type and other attributes of what we want to summarize. In this sense, an amorphic concept may be partially definable or, p-definable, for short. The concept of p-definability applies to all levels of the definability hierarchy.The theory of generalized definability is not a theory in the traditional spirit. The definitions are informal and conclusions are not theorems. Nonetheless, it serves a significant purpose by raising significant questions about a basic issue -- the issue of definability of concepts which lie at the center of scientific theories.---------*Professor in the Graduate School and Director, Berkeley Initiative in  Soft Computing (BISC).

A lét dolgairól általában:

"Mindig ugyanaz a nóta: angyalokal szeretnénk társalogni -- és ismerősőkkel 
kell vacsoráznunk egy vendéglőben."

"Két kategóriába tartoznak az emberek: az egyikbe azok, akik keresik az élet 
értelmét és nem találják, a másikba azok, akik nem keresték ugyan, de 
megtalálták."

"Imádság nélkül lehet élni, de az imádság lehetősége nélkül nem."

"Bárkit szerethetünk, kivéve felebarátunkat. A vallások azért győztek, mert 
tagadták ezt az evidenciát. Minthogy a felebaráti szeretet nem valósulhatott 
meg, nem kockáztatták azt, hogy t˙lhaladottá válnak. A parancs mindig 
'érvényes' maradt, '˙j', meghőkkentő, kívánatos, általánosan elfogadott 
parancs."

"Nagy kiváltság megőrizni az ép eszünket: bármikor megvonhatják tőlünk."

"Tudni, hogy mi a fontos -- az a legritkább dolog a világon. Mindazok kőzül 
akiket ismertem, oly kevesen tűntek ki ebben a tekintetben, hogy akár meg is 
nevezhetném őket. Négyen vagy őten voltak ősszesen."

"Abban a reményben olvasok ilyen sokat, hogy egy szép napon olyan magányra 
bukkanok, ami nagyobb, mint az enyém."

"Bármilyen éredemes ember is, aki becsvágyó, csak a felszínen lehet 
tisztességes. Csak a kőzőnyős emberekben bízzál meg."

Tudományos pályafutásra is vonatkoztatható dolgok:

"Annak alapján fognak megítélni, amit írtam, nem pedig annak alapján, amit 
olvastam. Ezt a nevetségesen nyilvánvaló tényt gyakran tévesztem szem elől. 
Minden kőnyv után, amit felfaltam, némi érdemet tulajdonítok magamnak."

"Abbahagyta az írást: már nem volt mit rejtegetnie."

"Száz levélből, amit egy író kap, egyetlen egy érdemel figyelmet. Csaknem 
valamennyit aszerint írják, hogy az ˙jságok, folyóiratok mennyit 
foglalkoznak Veled. Nem az inspirálja őket, amit írtál, hanem az, amit Rólad 
írtak. Minden területen minden "second hand". Legyünk szerények! Én 
megpróbáltam a szerénységet, váltakozó sikerrel. De azért remélem, hogy egy 
szép napon elsajátítom. Erre való a halál."

"A virtuozitás minden téren a semmi jele, a civilizációk hajnalán nem is 
találkozunk vele. Ezért van oly sok igazság a kezdetkor, és olyan kevés a 
siker beteljesedése idején. Csak a vágy pillanata számít, mindenben. Ami 
utána kővetkezik finomkodás, csak rutin."

" Egyetlen aranyszabály van az irodalomban és a művészetekben: nem hagyni 
hátra magunkról teljes képet."

In a true system...not all macroscopic properties follow from the properties of components and combinations. Macroscopic properties often do not result from static structures, but from dynamic interactions playing both within the system and between the system and its environment...A human being falling in love -- perhaps only once in a lifetime -- changes the life of the community of which he or she is a part. Such considerations already hint at the fact that a systemic view of necessity leads to a dynamic perspective. Quite generally,a system becomes observable and definable as a system through its interactions. (The Self-Organizing Universe." p24) 

ALBERT EINSTEIN 

"A human being is part of the Whole...He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest...a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is, in itself, a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security". [11] 

ERWIN SCHROEDINGER 

Hence this life of yours which you are living is not merely a piece of the entire existence, but is, in a certain sense, the whole; only this whole is not so constituted that it can be surveyed in one single glance. This, as we know, is what the Brahmins express in the sacred, mystic formula which is yet so simple and so clear, "Tat Tvam asi:" this is you...and not merely "someday:" Now, today, every day she is bringing you forth. Not once, but thousands upon thousands of times, Just as every day she engulfs you a thousands times over. For eternally and always there is only Now, One and the same Now; The present is the only thing that has no end. 

HINTZ PAGELS 

"We live in the wake of a physics revolution comparable to the Copernican demolition of the anthropocentric world -- a revolution which began with the invention of the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics in the first decades of this century and which has left most educated people behind" .[11] 

ALDOUS HUXLEY 

"Every individual is at once the beneficiary and the victim of the linguistic tradition into which he has been born - the beneficiary inasmuch as language gives access to the accumulated records of other people's experience, the victim in so far as it confirms him in the belief that reduced awareness is the only awareness and as it bedevils his sense of reality, so that he is all too apt to take his concepts for data, his words for actual things." [TDOP Huxley 23] 

ZEN 

"Do not mistake the pointing finger for the moon." [ ] 

ALFRED KORZYBSKI 

"The map is not the territory." [ ] 

ALAN WATTS 

The root of the difficulty is that we have developed the power of thinking so rapidly and one-sidedly that we have forgotten the proper relations between thoughts and events, words and things...What we have forgotten is that thoughts and words are conventions, and that it is fatal to take conventions too seriously." [ ] 

GOETHE 

"My friend, all theory is gray, and the Golden tree of life is green." 

DAVID BOHM 

"Indeed, to some extent it has always been necessary and proper for man, in his thinking, to divide things up, if we tried to deal with the whole of reality at once, we would be swamped. However when this mode of thought is applied more broadly to man's notion of himself and the whole world in which he lives, (i.e. in his world-view) then man ceases to regard the resultant divisions as merely useful or convenient and begins to see and experience himself and this world as actually constituted of separately existing fragments. What is needed is a relativistic theory, to give up altogether the notion that the world is constituted of basic objects or building blocks. Rather one has to view the world in terms of universal flux of events and processes." [5] 

FRITJOF CAPRA 

"The dramatic change in concepts and ideas that happened in physics during the first three decades of this century has been widely discussed by physicists and philosophers for more than fifty years...The intellectual crisis of quantum physicists in the 1920's is mirrored today by a similar but much broader cultural crisis. The major problems of our time...are all different facets of one single crisis, which is essentially a crisis of perception...Like the crisis in quantum physics, it derives from the fact that most of us. and especially our large social institutions, subscribe to the concepts of an outdated world view...At the same time researchers...are developing a new vision of reality...emerging from modern physics can be characterized by words like organic,holistic, and ecological. It might also be called a systems view, in the sense of general systems theory. The universe is no longer seen as a machine, made up of a multitude of objects, but has to be pictured as one indivisible dynamic whole whose parts are essentially interrelated and can be understood only as patterns of a cosmic process". What we are seeing today is a shift of paradigms not only within science but also in the larger social arena...The social paradigm now receding had dominated our culture for several hundred years, during which it shaped our modern Western society and has significantly influenced the rest of the world...This paradigm consists of...the view of the world as a mechanical system, the view of the body as a machine...the view of life as a competitive struggle...the belief of unlimited of unlimited progress achieved through economic and technological growth and the belief that the female is subsumed under the male...During recent decades all these assumptions have been severely limited and in need of radical revision. Indeed, such a revision is mow taking place...In science, the language of systems theory. and especially the theory of living systems, seems to provide the most appropriate formulation of the new ecological paradigm. I would like to now specify what is meant by the systems approach...I shall identify five criteria of systems approach...1. Shift from the parts to the whole. The properties of the parts can be understood only from the dynamics of the whole. In fact, ultimately there are no parts at all 2. Shift from the structure to the process. In the new paradigm, every structure is seen as a manifestation of an underlying process. 3. Shift from objective to epistemic science. In the new paradigm, it is believed the epistemology - the understanding of the process of knowledge - has to be included explicitly in the description of natural phenomenon...4. A shift from building to networks as a metaphor of knowledge. In the new paradigm, the metaphor of knowledge as a building is being replaced by that of the network. 5. Shift from truth to approximate descriptions. This insight is crucial to all modern science...in the new paradigm, it is recognized that all scientific concepts and theories are limited and approximate...One of the most important insights of the new systems theory is that life and cognition are inseparable. The process of knowledge is also the process of self-organization, that is, the process of life. Our conventional model of knowledge is one of representation or an image of independently existing facts which is the model derived from classical physics. From, the new systems point of view, knowledge is a part of the process of life, of a dialogue between subject and object. I believe that the world view implied by modern physics is inconsistent with our present society, which does not reflect the interrelatedness we observe in nature. To achieve such a state of dynamic balance, a radically different social and economic structure will be needed; a cultural revolution in the true sense of the word. The survival of our whole civilization may depend on whether we can bring about such a change. It will depend ultimately, on our ability to...experience the wholeness of nature and the art of living with it in harmony." 

LUDWIG VON BERTALANFFY

"Our civilization seems to be suffering a second curse of Babel: Just as the human race builds a tower of knowledge that reaches to the heavens, we are stricken by a malady in which we find ourselves attempting to communicate with each other in countless tongues of scientific specialization... The only goal of science appeared to be analytical, i.e., the splitting up of reality into ever smaller units and the isolation of individual causal trains...We may state as characteristic of modern science that this scheme of isolable units acting in one-way causality has proven to be insufficient. Hence the appearance, in all fields of science, of notions like wholeness, holistic, organismic, gestalt, etc., which all signify that, in the last resort, we must think in terms of systems of elements in mutual interaction..." [8] 

'There is this hope, I cannot promise you whether or when it will be realized - that the mechanistic paradigm, with all its implications in science as well as in society and our own private life, will be replaced by an organismic or systems paradigm that will offer new pathways for our presently schizophrenic and self-destructive civilization." [4] 

"General Systems theory should be an important means of instigating the transfer of principles from one field to another (so that it would) no longer be necessary to duplicate the discovery of the same principles in different fields." [ 8] 

ALFRED NORTH WHITEHEAD 

"While each scientific theory selects out and abstracts from the world's complexity a peculiar set of relations, philosophy cannot favor any particular region of human enterprise. Through conceptual experimentation it must construct a consistency that can accommodate all dimensions of experience, whether they belong to physics, physiology, psychology, biology, ethics, etc.." (-) 

GERARD t'HOOFT 

"A long standing ambition of physicists is to construct a single master theory that would incorporate all the known forces. One imagines that such a theory would reveal some deep connection between the various forces while accounting for their apparent diversity. Such a unification has not been attained, but in recent years some progress may have been made...What may ultimately prove more important, all four forces are now described by means of theories that have the same general form. Thus if physicists have yet to find a single key that fits all the known locks, at least all the needed keys can be cut from the same blank." 

JOHN BARROW 

"a theory of everything which will unite all the laws of nature into a single expression... an abbreviated representation of the logic behind the universes's properties...a single coherant framework...an encapulation of all the laws of nature...a simple and single representation...the ultimate directory...an independent prescription which appeals to simplicity, naturalness and economy...a union of perefect and unique intercompatibility..a general principle...which can be applied in a varity of different situations without becoming embroiled in their pecularities...Perhaps there exist a whole set of basic rules about the development of complexity which reduce to some of our simpler laws of nature in situations where the level of complexity is essential nil. If such rules do exist, then they are not like the laws which the particle physicists seek. But is there any evidence that such principles exist? collection of 1027 protons, neutrons and electrons may be all that a desk-top computer is at some level, but clearly the way in which those sub-attomic particles are put together, is what distinguishes the computer from a crowd of 1027 separate sub-atomic particles. ...The question of the existence of a "secret of the Universe" amounts to discovering whether there is some deep principle from which all other knowldege of the physical world follows..." 

GREGORY BATESON 

Of all these examples, the simplest but the most profound is the fact that it takes at least two somethings to create a difference. To produce news of difference, i.e., information, there must be two entities (real or imagined) such that the difference betweeen them can be immanent in their mutual relationships; and the whole affair must be such that news of their difference can be represented as a difference inside some information-processing entity, such as a brain, or, perhaps, acomputer. "To what questions have fifty years of science led me? This chapter has defined and exemplified a manner of search and therefore it is the moment to raise two questions; For what am I searching? To what questions have fifty years of science led me. The manner of search is plain to me, it might be called the method of double or multiple comparison." Thus the whole, in which such instances are placed...become a display inviting the reader to ahieve insight by comparing instances one with another," 

JONAS SALK 

"It appears that all units of reality are comprised of two basic elements in an asymmetrical binary relationship in dynamic interaction..." (p.38) 

"As noted above, one of the basic ideas that underlies my thinking, one of the images I have in mind when I contemplate the universe, is that it is constructed upon a simple pattern of order that may be seen in any and all phenomena, no matter how complex. The simple pattern is that of a binary relationship, recognized in a binary system. 

The implication here is that everything in nature, everything in the universe, is composed of networks of two elements, or two parts in functional relationship to each other..."(p.39) 

"The most fundamental phenomenon in the universe is relationship."(p.44) 

TAO TE CHING 

"The Tao begot one, one begot two, two begot three. The three begot the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things embrace Yin and express Yang. Harmony is achieved by combining these forces." 

"Out of what is in itselt and indistinguishable, swarming continuum, devoid of distinction (sunyata), or emphasis, our senses make for us, by attending to this motion and ignoring that, a world full of contrasts, of sharp accents, of abrupt changes, of picturesque light and shade. Helmholtz salys that we notice only those sensations which are signs to us of things. But what are things? Nothing, as we shall abundantly see, but special groups of sensible qualities, which happen practically or aesthetically to interest us, to which we therefore give substantive nbames, and which we exalt to this elclusive sttus of independence and dignity." 

Bergson was also aware of the spurios reality of "things" because, - as he himself pointed out - thought creates things by slicing up reality into small bits that it can easily grasp. Thus when you are think-ing you are thing=ing. Thought does not report things, it distorts reaiity to create things, and, as Bergson noted, "In so doing it allows what is the very essence of the real to escape." Thus to the extent we actually imagine a world of discrete and separate things, conceptions have become perceptions, and we have in this manner populated our universe with nothing but ghosts. Therefore the Madhyamika declares that Reality, besides being void of conceptual elaboration, is likewise Void of separate things. 

The doctrine of mutual interpenetration and mutual identification of the Dharmadhatu represents man's highest attempt to put into words that non-dual experience of Reality which itself remains wordless, ineffable, unspeakable, that nameless nothingness, 

The Dharmadhatu is not entirely foreign to Western thought, for something very similar to it is seen emerging in modern Systems Theory, in Gestalt psychology, and in the organismic philosophy of Whitehead. As a matter of fact, Western science as a whole is moving very rapidly towards a Dharmadhatu view of the cosmos, as biophysicist Ludwig von Bertalanffy states: We may state as a characteristic of modern sciece that the scheme of isolable units acting in one-way-causality has proved to be insufficient. Hence the appearence, in all fields of science, of notions like wholeness, holistic, organismic, gestalt, etc, which signify that in the last resort, we must think in terms of systems of elements in mutual interaction." 

Excerpted from the book "Zen Buddhism"
written by D.T. Suzuki. 

<li>"According to the philosophy of Zen, we are too much a slave to the conventional way of thinking. which is dualistic through and through. No "interpenetration" is allowed, there takes place no fusing of opposites in our everyday logic. What belongs to God is not of this world, and what is of this world is incompatible with the divine. Black is not white, and white is not black. Tiger is tiger, and cat is cat, and they will never be one. Water flows, a mountain towers. This is the way things or ideas go in this universe of the senses and syllogisms. Zen, however, upsets this scheme of thought and substitutes a new one in which there exists no logic, no dualistic arrangement of ideas. We believe in dualism chiefly because of our traditional training. Whether ideas really correspond to facts is another matter requiring a special investigation. Ordinarily we do not inquire into the matter, we just accept what is instilled into our minds; for to accept is more convenient and practical, and life is to a certain extent, though not in reality, made thereby easier. We are in nature conservatives, not because we are lazy, but because we like repose and peace, even superficially. But the time comes when traditional logic holds true no more, for we begin to feel contradictions and splits and consequently spiritual anguish. We lose trustful repose which we experienced when we blindly followed the traditional ways of thinking. Eckhart says that we are all seeking repose whether consciously or not just as the stone cannot cease moving until it touches the earth. Evidently the repose we seemed to enjoy before we were awakened to the contradictions involved in our logic was not the real one, the stone has kept moving down toward the ground. Where then is the ground of non-dualism on which the soul can be really and truthfully tranquil and blessed? To quote Echart again, "Simple people conceive that we are to see God as if He stood on that side and we on this. It is not so; God and I are one in the act of my perceiving Him." In this absolute oneness of things Zen establishes the foundations of its philosophy. The idea of absolute oneness is not the exclusive possesion of Zen. There are other religious and philosophies that preach the same doctrine. If Zen, like other monisms or theisms, merely laid down this principle and did not have anythng specifically to be known as Zen, it would have long ceased to exist as such. But there is in Zen something unique which makes up its life and justifies its claim to be the most precious heritage of Eastern culture. The following "Mondo" or dialogue (literally questioning and answering) will give us a glimsp into the ways of Zen, A monk asked Joshu, one of the greatest masters in China, "What is the ultimate word of Truth?" Instead of giving him any specific answer he made a simple response saying, "Yes." The monk who naturally failed to see any sense in this kind of response asked for a second time, and to this the Master roared back. "I am not deaf!" See how irrelevantly (shall I say) the all-important problem of absolute oneness or of the ultimate reason is treated here! But this is characteristic of Zen, this is where Zen transcends logic and overrides the tyranny and misrepresentation of ideas. As I have said before, Zen mistrusts the intellect, does not rely upon traditional and dualistic methods of reasoning, and handles problems after its own original manners....To understand all this, it is necessary that we should acquire a "third eye", as they say, and learn to look at things from a new point of view." </li>
